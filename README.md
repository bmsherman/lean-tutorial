# Installing Lean

- [Download Lean v3.3.0 (currently the latest release version)](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/releases/tag/v3.3.0)
- [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). There's also an emacs mode for Lean, but I haven't used it, and I highly recommend the VSCode plugin for Lean.
- Install the Lean extension for VSCode. (In the menu bar, go to View > Extensions, then search "lean", and install the extension called "lean".)
